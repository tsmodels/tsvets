Model Specification
}
\description{
Specifies a vector ETS model prior to estimation.
}
\usage{
vets_modelspec(y, level = c("constant", "diagonal", "common", "full", 
"grouped"), slope = c("none", "constant", "common", "diagonal", 
"full", "grouped"), damped = c("none", "common", "diagonal", 
"full", "grouped"), seasonal = c("none", "common", "diagonal", 
"full", "grouped"), group = NULL, xreg = NULL, xreg_include = NULL, 
frequency = 1, transformation = "box-cox", 
lambda = NULL, lower = 0, upper = 1, 
dependence = c("diagonal", "full", "equicorrelation", "shrinkage")) 
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{
A multivariate xts matrix.
}
\item{level}{
The dynamics for the level component.
}
\item{slope}{
The dynamics for the slope component.
}
\item{damped}{
The dynamics for the dampening component.
}
\item{seasonal}{
THe dynamics for the seasonal component.
}
\item{group}{
A vector of indices denoting which group the series
belongs to (when using the grouped dynamics).
}
\item{xreg}{
An xts matrix of external regressors.
}
\item{xreg_include}{
A matrix of dimension ncol(y) by ncol(xreg) populated with
either 0, 1 or 2+ (0 = no beta, 1 = individual beta and 
2 = grouped beta). It is also possible to have group wise pooling. 
For instance 2 variables sharing one pooled estimates, and 3 other 
variables sharing another grouped estimate would have values of
(2,2,3,3,3). The index for group wise pooling starts at 2 and should
be incremented for each new group added.
}
\item{transformation}{
A valid transformation for y from the \dQuote{tstransform} function in the
\dQuote{tsaux} package (currently box-cox or logit are available).
}
\item{lambda}{
The Box Cox power transformation vector (see \code{box_cox}) in the
\bold{tsaux} package. If a single NA, then it will calculate optimal lambda 
based on the multivariate Box Cox approach of Velila (1993),
else if a vector of NA values it will calculate the individual Box Cox
optimal parameters. Can also be either a single value (common lambda) or
vector of values (individual lambda).
}
\item{lower}{
The lower bound for the transformation.
}
\item{upper}{
The upper bound for the transformation.
}
\item{frequency}{
The seasonal frequency.
}
\item{dependence}{
The dependence structure to impose.
}
}
\details{
The specification allows to specify a vector additive damped ETS model
with options for the dynamics of the states and dependence.
}

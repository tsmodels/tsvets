# 2022-04-20 v0.4.3 [AG]
- Replaced all snow and doParallel functionality with future package. The cores
argument is now removed from options of all functions and instead the user
can just setup a plan via the future package which is much simpler and allows
much more customization. This may break backwards compatibility with versions
less than this which made use of the cores argument.
- Missing values are now allowed in the data for estimation. The series with
missing value are replaced with their prediction step (zero error). The 
covariance and likelihood is calculated based on the joint rows 
with non-missing values. The tsetsad (auto diff) is also updated to allow for
this case.
- tsaggregate and tsbacktest not fully tested/fixed yet [on next update]
- tsdecompose needs a simplify argument to align it with the other packages
method
- Changed the calling functionality for tstransform (using a list object)

# 2022-02-07 v0.4.2 [AG]
- Added aggregate option to the backtest function to allow backtesting with
aggregation of predictions given a weight vector (making use of the 
tsaggregate method). Prediction table appended with extra series 'Aggregate' in
that case.

# 2021-11-03 v0.4.1 [AG]
- Added autodiff option in estimation function which calls the tsvetsad package.
Currently optim (L-BFGS-B) and nlminb solvers supported for autodiff, and option
for use_hessian also included (for nlminb only).

# 2021-05-17 v0.4.0 [AG]
- Prediction table now includes the error (innovations) used as a tsmodel.predict 
class with original series being the estimated model residuals (with raw = TRUE 
so that it is on the same scale as the prediction innovations).

# 2021-04-08 v0.3.9 [AG]
- Added nloptr solver which is faster (particularly useful for larger problems), with customization
of the algorithm.
- ToDo: use BFGS C++ version so that overhead is reduced.

# 2020-10-29 v0.3.8 [AG]
- Added xreg group wise pooling option to the xreg_include. Also fixed an issue regarding the
indexing of xreg_include (added byrow = T to the Matrix construction).

# 2020-10-13 v0.3.7 [AG]
- Added gosolnp solver which provides better starting values for difficult problems.
- Added Changelog to package
